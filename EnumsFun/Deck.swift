//Next, open up Deck.swift. You'll find a class in this file called Deck that represents a deck of cards.
//Add a property called cards of type [Card] to Deck.
//Create a new initializer than creates a deck of playing cards. This should be an array of 52 Card instances of the appropriate rank and suit. (Hint: You can use a couple of for loops to do this -- remember how to create Rank and Suit enums from raw values!) Assign this to the cards property. Make sure the deck is shuffled! (Hint: You can call shuffle() on an Array to shuffle the contents. This method was provided to you.)
//Add a method called split(). This method should split the set of the cards in half and return a two-element tuple consisting of each half of the deck (i.e., the return type is ([Card], [Card]). (Hint: An Array method called split() has been written for you in the Array.swift file.)
